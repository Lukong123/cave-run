Caver run is basically a game with two players: Monster and Player

### Monster:
The goal of the monster is to stop the player and thereby ending the game

### Challenges

- **Game Approach**: With us frequently desinging non gaming systems which are not game related, designing for the cave run game was a little bit different but the experience was interesting.


- **Extension and Environment**: Team members encountered challenges on environments *windows* and also in installing C++ library on VS code

- **Desinging GUI**: Coming up with the Graphical User Interface(GUI) was a challenge.

- **Running Code**: After defining several classes and header classes we had challenge combinding all the classes for it to run effectively.  So though having the various classes, we are currently running the code from a single file with hardcoded instructions on some aspects like the rows and columns are included in the main file. 

### Running Code
`g++ main.cpp -0 main`
