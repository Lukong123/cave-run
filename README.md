Caver run is basically a game with two players: Monster and Player

The goal of the player is to to escape the cave. the cave is made up of series of room, some of them are safe while others could be either trap rooms or poisonous room. 

### Monster:
The goal of the monster is to stop the player and thereby ending the game

### Challenges
After defining several classes and header classes we had challenge combinding all the classes for it to run effectively.  So though having the various classes, we are currently running the code from a single file with hardcoded instructions on some aspects like the rows and columns are included in the main file. 

### Running Code
`g++ main.cpp -0 main`
